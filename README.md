# Radiator-Tools
Tools for modelling radiators, and aiding in the selection process

Radiator_rating.m uses equations and data from Compact Heat Exchangers Third Edition, by Kays and London to predict the heat dissipation rate of a radiator, given its dimensions and flow specification. Whilst it hasn't been experimentally verified, the outputs match what is expected.
